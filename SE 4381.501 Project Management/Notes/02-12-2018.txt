		User story
		Start with a collection of activities
			Process or product oriented, both are acceptable
		Organize into short managable tasks
			8 - 80 hours
			Easy to see progress in these increments
			Called work packages
			This is a assignable unit of work
			Should minimize dependencies between packages
		Used to assgined responsibility for tasks
		Each items needs a time and a cost estimate
		Work Packages aka tasks
			not too big not too small to be tracked
			Binary progress, done or not done
			
	Rolling Time Horizon
		Enables us to avoid planning things that are not in our control
		It is ineffective to plan in detail for future
		Plan in detail 2-3 months out
		Plan a medium level of detail 4-6 months out
		Plan roughly for the long term
		Withing 50% of estimation is normal
		Within 30% of estimation is good
