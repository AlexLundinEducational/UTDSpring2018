# see the *** tags for easy swap outs to paths
# the sections below use the paths for the make file variables

# I chose to install all my source code packages into the ~/libs directory
# this means all the installation steps handled the folder strucutre, and I tailored my make file around it
# During each install, the software created a /lib and a /include

# ***
# hard coded paths of libraries
# I pointed my install paths to ~, so the libraries unpacked to ~/lib for every install
LDFLAGS = -L$(HOME)/lib 

# these are the names of the library files to link with
# the complier will look in the library directory for any files specified here
# examples, ~/lib/libcryptopp.so and ~/lib/librudeconfig.so
LDLIBS = -lcryptopp -lrudeconfig

# During each install, the software placed a include folder in the ~ directory for each package
# So I pointed my include directory to ~/include
# which had my cryptopp, rude and tclap ready to go

# ***
# hard coded path for include directory
# I chose 
# use home value, assuming all include packages and librarys live in the root directory
# swap $(HOME) for any other file paths and the make file will take care of the rest
